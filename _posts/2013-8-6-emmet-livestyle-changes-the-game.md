title: Emmet LiveStyle changes the game
---

I know there are a bunch of live CSS editing tools out there; all of us have tried them and a couple of us use them daily. As a frontend developer, I think it’s key to speeding up the CSS implementation but I don’t use one often. I’ve really liked LiveReload, but it didn’t always help me out since I did a bunch of PhoneGap stuff and I had to complie (depending on the target device, it can be a headache). Well yesterday I was surprised because I think I fell in live with [Emmet LiveStyle](http://livestyle.emmet.io/ "Emmet LiveStyle").

It’s pretty basic.

1. Download the [Chrome extenstion](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/diebikgmpmeppiilkaijjbdgciafajmg)

2. Download the Sublime Text plugin via Package Control

3. Enable the extention, sync the css files accordionly

4. Code away!

Reason why I love it so far is because it lets me work directly in the file in Sublime Text. I think it’s prefect for PhoneGap implementation because after I make my edits in Chrome or Sublime, save the file and re-complie. That’s it! Nothing changes, except the fact that I don’t have to spend as much time guesstimating and more time testing out designs.
